What is the purpose of each method in the monitor?
*	The purpose of our methods is to replicate the methods in the semaphores that we used.
That means that tryEnter, enter and leave corresponds to tryAcquire, acquire and release.

They are still as expressive as semaphores but offers more flexibility.

How many conditional variables, if any, are needed in your solution? Justify your answer.
*	One conditional variable is used just because we are only dealing with two threads and
there's only two options for each sections of interest. This used to enqueue and dequeue processes.
